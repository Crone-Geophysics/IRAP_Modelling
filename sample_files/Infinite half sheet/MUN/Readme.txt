3D prism has the thickness = 2 m, therefore, its conductivity is:
1) 100S / 2m = 50 S/m,
2) 10S / 2m = 5 S/m,
3) 1S / 2m = 0.5 S/m

Two source (100 m x 100 m) locations:
1) S1: loop source centered at (x,y,z)=(0,0,0)
2) S2: loop source centered at (x,y,z)=(-175,0,0) m

Two measurement line locations:
1) 0N: line-1 at y=0, z=0, -200 m <= x <= 1100 m
2) 150N: line-2 at y=150 m, z=0, -200 m <= x <= 1100 m
